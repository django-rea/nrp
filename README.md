PAY ATTENTION!!!!! This version of valuenetwork is a fork of the FreedomCoop version, itself a fork of the original NRP software by Mikorizal in collaboration with Sensorica.

This fork will enable a full internal exchange network with mutual credit system, in addition to the existing comons-based collaborative production and value equation system.

valuenetwork
=====================

A prototype of Value Network Accounting, being developed in collaboration with http://www.sensorica.co/ , a pioneering value network.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.  Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning.

Background on Value Networks: http://www.sensorica.co/value-networks

The prototype used the https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account starter project, built on the Django framework.

See /docs/install.txt for developer installation instructions or [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

See /docs/install_ocp_debian_apache_ssl.rst for installation on debian-apache-ssl server. 

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.
