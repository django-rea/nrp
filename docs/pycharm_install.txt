Using PyCharm with DEEP
First install Pycharm IDE from JetBrains

create a virtual env within Pycharm
1. Go to project settings Ctrl + alt + s
2. Go into project interpreter in the top right there is a settings wheel button. From this wheel create a new virtual env with base interpreter Python 2.7

activate virtual env
1. navigate to the virtual env within the terminal in PyCharm
2. then into the scripts or bin folder
3. run the activate file

clone repo and install modules
1. clone the valuenetwork repo inside the virtualenv.
https://github.com/gopacifia/DEEP.git
2. cd DEEP
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

This should get the project with all the requirements installed, but make sure the project interpreter is set to the virtual env created

Also the only other problem I came across was Pillow wouldn't install so a couple of requirements weren't able to install either
To fix run below command in pycharm terminal
easy_install Pillow

Run Server
1. Under Tools menu select run Manage.py
2. This should open a tab in Pycharm where you can type the run commands
3. run the tests
test valuenetwork.valueaccounting.tests
4. crank up the django server
runserver
5. point browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
