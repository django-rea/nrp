The django-rea organization is created in aim to create a set of building blocks on which other Django apps can build
upon to create network resource planning systems - NRP, as opposed to the more restricted common patterns we encounter
in enterprise resource planning systems - ERP.

The project starts from the `valuenetwork project <https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork>`, centered around
`value networks <http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page>`. This evolved into a NRP gravitating towards openness
and transparency. As we understand somebody's needs might be different than those we have been using it for thus this
project.

This project is born to create a set of modular apps on which to develop business apps. In a sense it's another
framework in your toolbox.

In django-rea we are going a step forward generalizing and modularizing the previous projects since we think and
understand REA modelling provides an invaluable asset in business driven applications.

We encourage everyone to participate.
