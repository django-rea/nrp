To install on Ubuntu for development:
(see end for how to rerun after installation)

You need python 2.7+, but *not* python 3+

1. install pip globally: (see below if you already have pip installed)
http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#prerequisites

May need to install easy_install first: 
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Then install pip: 
sudo easy_install pip

2. install virtualenv:
http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html

sudo pip install virtualenv 

3.  (highly recommended but not necessary):
install virtualenvwrapper:
http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper 
export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Step 5 assumes virtualenvwrapper

* If you already have pip, virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper, 
you might want to upgrade them:
sudo pip install -U pip
sudo pip install -U virtualenv
sudo pip install -U virtualenvwrapper

You might also need to upgrade setuptools:
sudo pip install -U setuptools

(Rdflib, one of the requirements, needs
setuptools version 18.5 or above.)

4. unless you don't have it already: install git
sudo apt-get install git

5. create a virtualenv (assuming you installed virtualenvwrapper):
mkvirtualenv vn --system-site-packages 
workon vn
    (Or if you already have a vn, give it a different name.)
cdvirtualenv

6. clone the valuenetwork repo inside the vn virtualenv.
git clone https://github.com/gopacifia/DEEP.git
 
7. cd DEEP

8. pip install -r requirements.txt --trusted-host dist.pinaxproject.com

9. create the sqlite database
./manage.py migrate

10. create a superuser for yourself so you can login:
./manage.py createsuperuser

***Note: these fixtures are broken now. Will be fixed,
but in the meantime, get a test database from somebody.***
11. do this to install some starter facets and patterns:
./manage.py loaddata ./fixtures/starters.json
And this to load some starter help:
./manage.py loaddata ./fixtures/help.json

12. run the tests
./manage.py test valuenetwork.valueaccounting.tests

13. crank up the django server
./manage.py runserver

14. point browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

15. You may also want a local_settings.py file
in the same directory as settings.py
You can look at local_settings_example.py for ideas,
but don't use it as-is. (It has two database sections.
You should keep only the sqlite one.)

16. When you log in for the first time, you must 
create an EconomicAgent for yourself. Go into Admin,
which is on the pulldown menu by your username on the upper right.
Click on Economic agents, and then click on "add economic agent".
When you have added as much info as you want, go to the bottom
of the page, and select your username in the first User
select widget.
You will be the only user who will need to do this.
All other Agents and Users can be created from 
the Organization page.

17.  To be able to run scripts in ./manage.py shell_plus:

pip install ipython


===To rerun after installation===

workon vn
    (or whatever you called your virtualen in step 5 above)
cdvirtualenv
cd DEEP
./manage.py runserver
