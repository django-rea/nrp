PAY ATTENTION!!!!! This version of valuenetwork is a fork of the FreedomCoop version, itself a fork of the original NRP software by Mikorizal in collaboration with Sensorica.

This fork is to develop DEEP, the Democratic Emancipatory Economy Platform, that will enable a full internal exchange network with mutual credit system, in addition to the existing comons-based collaborative production and value equation system.

valuenetwork
=====================

A prototype of Value Network Accounting, being developed in collaboration with http://www.sensorica.co/ , a pioneering value network.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.  Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning.

[Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JEPsxJOjEMHNhvIGLXzcvovrpXqpoY75YaPHDKI0t9w/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

Background on Value Networks: http://www.sensorica.co/value-networks

The prototype used the https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account starter project, built on the Django framework.

See /docs/install.txt for developer installation instructions or [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

See /docs/install_ocp_debian_apache_ssl.rst for installation on debian-apache-ssl server. 

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.

DEEP
=====================
Democratic Emancipatory Economic Platform


It is an open source software to build and boost economically fair, democratic and emancipatory communities.


Why?
Because the capitalist economic system generates inequality, 
exploitation, poverty, marginalization and ecological destruction, we 
need to build alternative systems.


What's wrong with capitalism?
We don't argue the rich are the bad guys. We argue that mechanisms are inappropriate for an adequate organization of society:


money creation is centralized and accessible only to capitalistsproductive resources are accessible only to capitalistswork retribution is a result of unequal power relationshipsunemployment and economic crisis are embedded in the systemmarket prices work in favor of company owners, not in favor of consumers and workersthe state has to take responsibility of the market where it is inefficient (where real needs are!)artifially needed economic growth generates a whole superficial 
production/work/consumption system that is alienating and destructive.

How to change this?
Decentralizing money creation:
In a neighborhood with high unemployment, people have no money so they 
dont' consume. Local businesses close and unemployment keep rising, 
affecting the broader economy which in turn slows, entering a vicious 
circle.
But if neighbors create a local exchange system or a time bank with 
mutual credits they can reactivate their economy.
Pedro couldn't get a haircut from Nadia because he had no money. Nadia 
couldn't pay Agy for taking care of her children since she had no client
 and thus no money.
With the mutual credit system, Pedro can have a haircut, his virtual 
account goes in negative (credit) to -30 (for the 30 minutes worth 
haircut) and Nadia sees her account raise to +30. Nadia can easily pay 
Agy for her work (180) and her account goes to - 150. Agy can now get a 
medical consultation with her positive account. The economy is 
reactivated.


The same goes for businesses. In economic turn downs, businesses face
 cash issues. They sometimes can't pay their suppliers in time, putting 
them in dangerous situations. If they can't get input supplies they 
won't be able to produce anymore, and will have to close business. Which
 would put their workers and their supplier's workers out of work.
With the credit system, they could still get supplies and pay their 
workers in credit as well. So they can continue business and sell to 
consumers (who are other workers that have been paid in credit). The 
economic activity is maintained.


Democratic access to productive resources (reducing inequalities):
Since businesses can access input supplies through credit, you don't 
have to be a capitalist to borrow money from the bank in order to 
improve your productive capacity. This will only depend on your business
 scale, so you won't need investors to fund you and to take the benefits
 of your and the workers' work.


Autonomous retribution (further reducing inequalities):
Since people do not depend on employers anymore to receive a salary 
(they can work autonomously since they can access productive resources),
 they will have more powers in negotiating retribution. In a time bank, 
this is even easier since everyone earns 60 minutes for one hour work 
(apart from special cases).
